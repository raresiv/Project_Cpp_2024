# Option Pricing Project

This project was developed as part of the "C++ for Finance" module during our 4th year at ESILV Engineering School. Its aim is to implement pricing methods for European, American, and Asian options.

## Overview

1. Black-Scholes Model:

- Implementation of European vanilla options (Call and Put).
- Pricing and delta calculation using the Black-Scholes formula.

2. Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) Model:

- Implementation of a binary tree for modeling asset price evolution.
- Pricing European options through backward induction and closed-form solutions.
- Support for European digital options.

3. Path-Dependent Options and Monte Carlo Simulations:

- Support for Asian options with path-dependent payoffs.
- Monte Carlo simulations for pricing, including confidence intervals.

4. American Options in the Binomial Model:

- Extension of the CRR model to support American options.
- Computation of early exercise policies.

5. Black-Scholes Approximation Using the Binomial Model:

- Comparison of the binomial model with Monte Carlo and closed-form methods for European options.

## Requirements

Visual Studio with C++.
